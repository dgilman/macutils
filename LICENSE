Note:
In these programs all algorithms are implemented based on publicly available

Clarified Copyright Notice:
--
Almost all of the code is either created by me from scratch or loosely
based on *algorithms* that are publicly available.  Most of the algorithms
are actually found by reverse engineering and interpretation of the results.
In some cases the algorithms came from the acknowledged sources, but the
implementation is my own.

As far as sources are concerned, the only execptions are
macutil/de_compress.c and macutil/de_lzah.c  They have a clear relation
with the original source.  de_lzah.c is loosely based on LZSS.C in
LHarc.  As the file says:

        Use, distribute, and modify this program freely.

[..]

The point where GPL might come in is in the Zoom part (macutil/zma.c),
but I do not think this is so; the algorithm is found from a file
mailed to me by the author, which would fall under the GPL, but the
implementation is completely different.

Clarified Licensing Terms:
--
According to Dutch law it is *not* possible to release something in the
public domain.  So I might state that but I would not be bound by it...
Yup, copyright is a mess.  But I indeed do have the copyright, but it may
be distributed and used for any purpose.
